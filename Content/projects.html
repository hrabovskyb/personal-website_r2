          						<h3>Electric Motor Test Rig</h3>
          						<h4>Role: Project Lead</h4>
          						<p>Since the Aero design team uses exclusively electric motors for our projects, a solution for safely and effectively testing these motors is essiential. A solution to collect the data and store it for analysis and future referencing was desired.</p>
          						<p>A large cage that was constructed for a motor test by a former senior design team stand was generously donated to the club. However, the electronics were not included. Electronics, along with the design and manufacture of a mounting interface between the motor and the test stand, were needed for operation.</p>
          						<p>The hardware interfacing the motor and the test stand was designed in Solidworks. All flat components were machined out of aluminum by Aero members. All other hardware, such as screws and standoffs, were purchased from a hardware store.</p>
          						<p>An Arduino Uno was used to interface and control all of the electronics. A simple bar-style load cell is used to take thrust readings of the motor. The battery and electronic speed controller both interface with a control box outside of the testing cage for eas of access. The control box includes controls to arm/disarm the system, turn data logging on or off, tare the load cell, and control the speed of the motor. It also includes a screen that displays real-time thrust, throttle, voltage, and current values. The box itself was created with wood pieces cut on a laser cutter.</p>
          						<p>When data logging is enabled, all relavent data is output serially. When connected to a serial monitor program such as PuTTY on a computer this data can be recorded for processing. A spreadsheet controlled with VBA and macros was created to facilitate quick and easy processing of the data. The spreadsheet also allows for archiving of results in order to reference them when doing research on power plants for future projects</p>

          						<h3>2017 AIAA Competition: Folding Aircraft</h3>
          						<h4>Role: Fuselage Team and Manufacturing</h4>
          						<p>For the past two years, the Aero Design Team has worked to build an aircraft to the AIAA Design, Build, Fly competition specifications. In 2017, we successfully completed our aircraft and atteneded the flyoff hosted in Tempe, Arizona. This was the first time that the club had atteneded a competition in more than six years. For this years competition a plane had to be constructed to carry a number of hockey pucks as payload. In addition to the payload requirement the plane had to fold to fit into a tube. The plane then had to be assembled upon removal from the tube without any sort of tools - all features had to be self locking. The plane was required to be hand launched. Full rules and specifications can be found on the AIAA webpage, <a href="http://www.aiaadbf.org/Rules/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
          						<p>As the fuselage team's design/manufacturing lead, I was responsible for conducting design reviews within the team to discuss our best options for carying payload as well as designing components that would fold, allowing us to fit the aircraft into the tube. In addition to design reviews with our team, we also conducted meetings with the other component teams to ensure proper integration of the different parts of the aircraft. I also oversaw the general modeling and manufacturing processes of the various fuseleage concepts and designs that were developed.</p>
          						<p>While at the competition in Arizona, we successfully passed tech inspection on the second day, after overcoming some difficulties with our wing/fuselage integration. After tech inspection was passed, we successfully flew the first 2 missions, the first with no payload and the second with three hockey pucks for our payload. Unfortunately, on the third and final flight our wing integration failed, causing a crash midflight. The plane was sadly un-reparable with the time and resource contraints of the competition. </p>

          						<h3>Computer Power Supply Conversion</h3>
          						<h4>Role: Individual Project</h4>
          						<p>The power supply that was used to power the Aero club's battery chargers failed just days before competition and a fast solution was needed to replace it. An unused computer power supply was stripped down. The wires carying the desired voltages were kept while all others were trimmed off. The ends of the wires were then terminated with banana connectors for easy use. Two of the power supply's wires are connected through a momentary switch that when pressed will short the two wires together and turn the power supply on.</p>
          						<p>The power supply now functions as a basic bench top power supply and is able to supply a range of voltages, including that needed to power the battery charger. This saved the club from having to buy a brand new power supply that may or may not have arrived by the required time.

			            <p>Each year, RIT hosts a creativity festival, <a href="http://www.rit.edu/imagine/" target="_blank">Imagine RIT</a>, where students can showcase the work that they have been doing throughout the academic year. With each new year President Bill Destler issues a challenge competition to the students. In 2015, the challenge involved using the AR.Drone 2.0 by Parrot to complete two sets of tasks. The first set included manually piloting the drone and capturing images of pre-defined targets. The second asked students to program their provided quadcopter to complete an autonomous task (as decided by the teams). A full description of the competition and rules can be found <a href="http://www.rit.edu/imagine/contests-jetsons.php" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			            <p>For the manual control portion of the competition we controlled the quadcopter from a laptop using a custom program that utilized a currently existing node.js library. For the autonomous portion we attempted to have the quadcopter catch a ball that was thrown by one of our members by calculating where the ball was going to land and moving to that location. The application for this task leveraged an openCV program written for color tracking. A camera on the laptop tracked the drone and the ball and would send commands to the drone depending on its location relative to where it had calculated the ball would land.</p>
			            <p>As project lead it was my responsibility to drive the team, cosisting of 4 additional Mechanical Engineering students, towards our goal and to delegate the various programming and testing tasks. The biggest challenge was learning the various programming languages that were used to complete the challenge. Unfortunately, after all the work, our quadcopter was unable to successfully complete the autonomous task on the day of the competititon. This was due to the fact that there was an incredible amount of visual noise that the camera saw. Since the execution of our task relied on color tracking, it made it impossible for our program to get accurate data from only the quadcopter and the ball.</p>

			            <p> This project began as a personal endeavor into the hobby of remote controlled multi-rotor platforms. There are many off-the-shelf quadcopters that can be purchased, but I was interested in designing my own frame and choosing my own electronic components. There were various reivisions of the frame, each one (except for the final revision) being designed in either Autodesk Inventor or Solidworks. Most of the parts were then cut on a laser cutter. A commercial frame was purchased for the final revision.</p>
			            <p>The project of building the platform began with the final goal of creating my own control system for flying. Once the platform was created I began to get interested in aerial photography using multi-rotors. In the future I do plan on finishing the control system and implementing a camera gimbal and camera to the bottom of the platform.
